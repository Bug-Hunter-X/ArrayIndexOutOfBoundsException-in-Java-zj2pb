This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the common error of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The program attempts to access an element of an array using an index which is out of the bounds.  The solution file provides a corrected version of the code which avoids this error by using proper loop termination condition. The bug is caused by off-by-one error in loop indexing.
